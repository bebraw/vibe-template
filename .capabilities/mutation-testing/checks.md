# Checks

Run these after applying the mutation testing kit.

```bash
npm run mutation
```

Expected:

- Stryker mutates runtime source files only.
- Unit tests run through the Vitest runner.
- TypeScript checking rejects type-invalid mutants before running tests.
- Reports are written under `reports/mutation/`.
- Temporary Stryker files stay under ignored `.stryker-tmp/`.
- The command exits non-zero when the mutation score is below the configured break threshold.

Also run the target repo's full quality gate before treating the change as ready.
If the target repo adds the optional deep gate, run `npm run quality:gate:deep` once to verify its integration.
