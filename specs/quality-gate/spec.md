# Feature: Quality Gate

## Blueprint

### Context

The template needs a verification baseline that stays strict enough for end-to-end confidence while still returning useful failures quickly during normal development.

### Architecture

- **Fast gate:** `npm run quality:gate:fast`
- **Formatting scope:** project-owned code and documentation, excluding duplicated or vendored skill material listed in `.prettierignore`
- **Correctness lint:** `npm run lint`
- **Affected guardrails:** `npm run quality:affected`
- **Browser gate:** `npm run e2e`
- **Affected test gate:** `npm run test:affected`
- **Advisory codebase diagnostics:** `npm run diagnostics:codebase`
- **Changed-code readability diagnostics:** `npm run diagnostics:readability`
- **Whole-repo health diagnostics:** `npm run diagnostics:health`
- **Full mutation gate:** `npm run mutation`
- **Incremental mutation gate:** `npm run mutation:incremental`
- **Full gate:** `npm run quality:gate`
- **Local workflow:** `npm run ci:local`
- **Local workflow concurrency:** Agent CI job auto-concurrency
- **Local workflow failure mode:** pause failed Agent CI runners for retry
- **Retry command:** `npm run ci:local:retry -- --name <runner-name>`
- **Remote workflow:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Remote expensive-gate classifier:** `scripts/classify-expensive-ci.mjs`
- **Remote expensive-gate policy:** skip browser and mutation setup/execution only when every changed file is in a documented non-runtime area; run on unknown paths or unavailable ranges
- **CI dependency install:** plain `npm ci`
- **Action pinning:** every GitHub Actions `uses:` reference must use a full commit SHA
- **Git hook path:** `.githooks/`
- **Hook setup script:** `scripts/setup-git-hooks.mjs`
- **Affected guardrail logic:** `scripts/run-affected-guardrails.mjs`
- **Affected test logic:** `scripts/run-affected-tests.mjs`
- **Affected file helper logic:** `scripts/affected-file-utils.mjs`
- **Runtime pin source:** `package.json#engines.node`
- **Package manager hint source:** `package.json#packageManager`
- **Browser runtime image:** `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.61.1-noble`
- **Coverage gate logic:** `scripts/run-coverage-gate.mjs`
- **Worker client-code guard:** `scripts/assert-no-worker-client-scripts.mjs`
- **Codebase diagnostics config:** `.fallowrc.json`
- **Mutation config:** `stryker.config.mjs`
- **Local mutation concurrency:** 50% of available parallelism
- **GitHub mutation concurrency:** 100% of available parallelism
- **Readiness baseline:** `npm run quality:gate` and `npm run ci:local` for non-documentation changes
- **Documentation-only exception:** documentation-only changes may skip `npm run ci:local` when they do not alter executable config, generated artifacts, package metadata, source code, or tests

### Anti-Patterns

- Do not collapse fast and browser verification back into one opaque step without a concrete reason.
- Do not treat colocated tests or test-support files as runtime source code when deciding whether unit coverage is missing.
- Do not weaken the full gate just to make iteration faster.
- Do not spend the full formatting budget on duplicated or vendored skill documentation that the project does not author.
- Do not replace Prettier formatting or TypeScript project checking with Oxlint.
- Do not enable broad Oxlint style, restriction, pedantic, or type-aware rule sets without an explicit decision and compatibility review.
- Do not treat advisory Fallow diagnostics as a replacement for formatting, type checking, runtime audit, unit coverage, browser tests, mutation testing, or Worker-specific guardrails.
- Do not treat targeted iteration checks as a replacement for the readiness baseline unless the change is documentation-only and qualifies for the documented Agent CI exception.
- Do not add undocumented workflow write targets for generated output, local state, caches, archives, or tool artifacts.

## Contract

### Definition of Done

- [ ] The fast gate covers formatting, Oxlint correctness checks, type checking, Worker client-code guardrails, runtime audit, and unit coverage.
- [ ] The affected guardrail path scopes formatting, Oxlint, JavaScript syntax checks, Worker client-code checks, package audit, and unit tests to affected files when possible.
- [ ] The affected test gate runs tests related to affected runtime files, runs affected unit test files directly, and falls back to full coverage for broad test environment changes or affected runtime files with no related tests.
- [ ] The advisory codebase diagnostics report changed-code readability risk, whole-repo health, hotspots, duplication, and cleanup evidence without becoming part of the hard quality gate.
- [ ] The browser gate covers the Playwright baseline.
- [ ] The full mutation gate covers runtime `src/**/*.ts` files with Stryker, Vitest, and TypeScript checking.
- [ ] The incremental mutation gate reuses prior Stryker results for repeated local quality-gate runs while preserving a complete mutation report.
- [ ] The full gate runs the fast, browser, and incremental mutation gates in order.
- [ ] The repo-managed `pre-push` hook runs affected-file guardrails before a push leaves the machine.
- [ ] Local and remote CI use the same split verification model for non-documentation changes.
- [ ] Remote browser and mutation jobs avoid dependency installation and gate execution for known non-runtime-only changes.
- [ ] Documentation-only changes can skip Agent CI when they do not alter executable behavior or workflow configuration.
- [ ] The spec is updated in the same change set.

### Regression Guardrails

- `npm run quality:gate:fast` must remain a useful faster signal than the full gate.
- Prettier must ignore `.github/skills/` and `.codex/skills/**/references/` while continuing to check project-owned skill entry points, specs, ADRs, and documentation.
- `npm run lint` must use the pinned Oxlint dependency, enable only its default rules, and fail when warnings are reported.
- `npm run quality:affected` must avoid full-repo work when affected files make a narrower check sufficient.
- `npm run test:affected` must avoid full coverage work when affected runtime or unit test files can be checked through related or direct Vitest runs.
- `npm run quality:gate` must continue to represent the local baseline verification path.
- `npm run diagnostics:codebase` must remain advisory and must not be required by the baseline readiness path.
- Fallow diagnostics must use `--no-cache` in repo scripts so normal diagnostic runs do not create a persistent `.fallow/` cache.
- `npm run mutation` must fail when the mutation score is below the configured break threshold.
- `npm run mutation:incremental` must fail when the resulting mutation score is below the configured break threshold.
- `npm install` must keep the repo-managed `pre-push` hook configured without requiring extra setup steps.
- The CI workflow must cancel superseded runs for the same ref.
- The CI workflow must run browser and mutation gates when any changed path is runtime-related or unknown, when no reliable changed-file range is available, or when classification fails.
- The CI workflow may skip browser and mutation setup and execution only when every changed file is in the classifier's explicit non-runtime allowlist.
- The CI workflow must read the pinned Node version from `package.json` instead of a separate version file.
- The CI workflow must keep using npm for install and verification steps without depending on one exact npm patch release.
- The npm release used by CI must stay inside the supported npm range declared in `package.json`.
- CI jobs must install dependencies with plain `npm ci`.
- Local Agent CI must rely on its built-in warm-cache preparation and isolated per-job dependency views instead of repo-local install locking.
- Local Agent CI must explicitly prewarm through one stable npm install step before parallel jobs start.
- The CI workflow must pin every GitHub Actions `uses:` action reference to a full commit SHA, with any tag information kept only as a comment.
- The browser CI job must use a container image whose version exactly matches the pinned `@playwright/test` version instead of reinstalling Chromium at runtime.
- The coverage gate must only require unit tests when runtime `src/` code exists.
- The coverage gate must work in both the normal workspace and local Agent CI's warmed `node_modules` layout.
- The Worker client-code guard must fail on inline `<script>` tags, inline event-handler attributes, and `javascript:` URLs in Worker/view runtime files.
- The affected guardrail path must pass only affected Worker/view runtime files to the Worker client-code guard.
- The affected guardrail path must pass only affected JavaScript and TypeScript files to Oxlint.
- The affected guardrail path must run JavaScript syntax checks only for affected JavaScript files.
- The affected guardrail path must run package audit only when package metadata or lockfiles change.
- The affected guardrail path must skip unit tests when no runtime or unit test files are affected.
- The affected test path must run full unit coverage when package metadata, TypeScript config, Vitest config, coverage-gate logic, or affected-test logic changes.
- The affected test path must run full unit coverage when affected-file helper logic changes.
- The affected test path must run full unit coverage when affected runtime files have no related tests and no affected unit test files were supplied.
- The affected guardrail path may fall back to project-level type checking or coverage when a safe per-file check is not available.
- The repo's local CI scripts should use the repo-pinned `agent-ci` binary directly instead of carrying repo-specific runtime patching or install locking.
- The canonical local CI script should rely on Agent CI's managed warm cache and per-job dependency isolation instead of forcing `--jobs 1` to avoid dependency races on macOS-hosted Docker.
- The explicit Agent CI prewarm selector and its workflow install-step id must stay aligned.
- The canonical local CI script should use pause-on-failure so agents can fix and retry a failed runner without restarting the whole workflow.
- The canonical local CI script should combine quiet rendering with Agent CI's structured JSON event stream so agents receive run, job, step, pause, diagnostic, and completion progress without parsing animated terminal output.
- Agent command wrappers should use an unbuffered passthrough mode for local CI so structured lifecycle events reach the caller while the workflow is still running.
- The local verification workflow should document macOS as the supported host baseline instead of implying cross-platform support.
- The Playwright server path must avoid macOS file-watcher exhaustion in local runs without changing the normal `npm run dev` workflow.
- The local CI documentation must cover the no-`origin` case through `.env.agent-ci` and `GITHUB_REPO` instead of treating that warning as normal noise.
- The local CI Docker daemon override must use Agent CI's `AGENT_CI_DOCKER_HOST` variable instead of the general Docker CLI `DOCKER_HOST` variable.
- Local Playwright browser installation should go through a pinned repo script instead of ad hoc `npx playwright install ...` usage.
- Targeted checks may be documented for iteration, but `npm run quality:gate` and `npm run ci:local` remain the readiness baseline for non-documentation changes.
- Documentation-only changes may skip `npm run ci:local` when they do not alter executable config, generated artifacts, package metadata, source code, or tests.
- Mutation testing must exclude colocated tests, end-to-end tests, declarations, and `src/test-support.ts` from mutation.
- Mutation testing must use the Vitest runner's per-test coverage analysis and related-test narrowing rather than an ad hoc minimization wrapper.
- Mutation testing must set Stryker worker concurrency as a percentage of available parallelism instead of a fixed worker count.
- The isolated GitHub mutation job must override local Stryker concurrency to 100% without changing the 50% local default.
- GitHub Actions must run the full mutation gate instead of the incremental mutation gate.
- Mutation reports and Stryker incremental data must be written under ignored `reports/`, and Stryker's temporary sandbox must stay under ignored `.stryker-tmp/`.
- New workflow write targets must be documented when they are introduced.
- Manually created Fallow caches must stay ignored under `.fallow/`.

### Verification

- **Automated checks:** `npm run quality:gate` and `npm run ci:local`
- **Local setup check:** `git config --get core.hooksPath` should resolve to `.githooks`
- **Workflow shape:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` should show separate fast and browser jobs, with repository-shape validation in the fast job

### Scenarios

**Scenario: Contributor wants an affected local signal**

- Given: a change is still being iterated locally
- When: the contributor runs `npm run quality:affected`
- Then: guardrails run against affected files where possible and skip unrelated work

**Scenario: Contributor wants an affected unit test signal**

- Given: runtime or unit test files are affected
- When: the contributor runs `npm run test:affected`
- Then: Vitest checks related runtime tests or affected unit test files without running unrelated unit tests when that is safe

**Scenario: Contributor wants codebase readability diagnostics**

- Given: a change is ready for review or a refactor target is unclear
- When: the contributor runs `npm run diagnostics:codebase`
- Then: Fallow reports changed-code readability risk, health scoring, hotspots, duplication, and cleanup evidence without replacing the baseline gate

**Scenario: Contributor wants a fast baseline signal**

- Given: a change that does not need immediate browser verification
- When: the contributor runs `npm run quality:gate:fast`
- Then: formatting, correctness linting, typing, audit, and unit coverage run without waiting for Playwright

**Scenario: Fast formatting skips vendored skill material**

- Given: the repository contains duplicated GitHub skill content and vendored Codex skill references
- When: the contributor runs `npm run format:check`
- Then: Prettier checks project-owned code and documentation without traversing those excluded skill trees

**Scenario: Contributor introduces a JavaScript or TypeScript correctness issue**

- Given: a JavaScript or TypeScript file violates an Oxlint default rule
- When: the contributor runs `npm run lint`, the fast gate, or the applicable affected-file guardrail
- Then: the command fails without replacing Prettier formatting or TypeScript project checking

**Scenario: Full verification before landing code changes**

- Given: a non-documentation change is ready for review or merge
- When: the contributor runs `npm run quality:gate` and `npm run ci:local`
- Then: the fast, browser, and local incremental mutation verification paths pass

**Scenario: Agent monitors local CI progress**

- Given: an agent runs the canonical local CI command
- When: Agent CI advances through the workflow or pauses on a failure through any required command wrapper
- Then: the command emits structured lifecycle events, including step transitions and the paused runner's retry command, without requiring animated terminal output

**Scenario: Documentation-only change**

- Given: a change only edits documentation
- And: it does not alter executable config, generated artifacts, package metadata, source code, or tests
- When: the contributor runs the smallest relevant local checks
- Then: they may skip `npm run ci:local`

**Scenario: Remote non-runtime-only change**

- Given: a push or pull request changes only documented non-runtime paths
- When: GitHub Actions classifies the changed commit range
- Then: the fast job still runs while browser and mutation dependency installation and gate execution are skipped

**Scenario: Remote change classification is uncertain**

- Given: a changed path is not explicitly classified as non-runtime or the commit range cannot be inspected
- When: GitHub Actions classifies the change
- Then: browser and mutation verification run instead of risking a false skip

**Scenario: Contributor checks test assertion strength**

- Given: runtime `src/**/*.ts` code has colocated unit tests
- When: the contributor runs `npm run mutation`
- Then: Stryker mutates runtime source only and fails if the mutation score is below the configured break threshold

**Scenario: Contributor repeats the local quality gate**

- Given: Stryker has an existing incremental report under `reports/`
- When: the contributor runs `npm run quality:gate`
- Then: the fast and browser gates pass before Stryker reuses valid prior mutant results and reruns affected mutants

**Scenario: GitHub verifies mutation strength**

- Given: a push or pull request runs GitHub Actions
- When: the `quality-mutation` job runs
- Then: it runs the full `npm run mutation` command at 100% runner concurrency instead of the incremental mutation command

**Scenario: Contributor adds browser behavior to a Worker view**

- Given: a Worker-rendered view needs browser-side behavior
- When: the contributor adds inline executable browser code to `src/worker.ts` or `src/views/**/*.ts`
- Then: the fast quality gate fails and points them toward typed TypeScript modules instead

**Scenario: Contributor pushes with a broken fast gate**

- Given: the repo was bootstrapped with `npm install`
- When: the contributor runs `git push` while the fast gate is red
- Then: the `pre-push` hook runs affected-file guardrails and the push is blocked before remote CI starts

**Scenario: New push supersedes an old CI run**

- Given: a newer push exists on the same ref
- When: GitHub Actions schedules the new workflow run
- Then: the older in-progress run is canceled instead of continuing to consume time

**Scenario: Contributor audits remote action references**

- Given: the remote CI workflow uses reusable GitHub Actions
- When: the contributor reviews `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Then: every `uses:` action reference points at a full commit SHA instead of a mutable tag
