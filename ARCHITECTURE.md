# Architecture

This file stores cross-cutting rules that apply to the whole repo and to projects cloned from it.

Use this file for global constraints. Use feature specs under `specs/` for domain-specific behavior and contracts.

## Global Rules

- Keep the template lightweight, reusable, easy to clone, and easy to prune.
- Treat repo documentation as living context that should evolve with the code.
- Treat architectural decisions as explicit records, not implicit tribal knowledge.
- Treat specs and ADRs as the durable source of truth for expected behavior and architectural intent. Code, including AI-generated code, is only acceptable when it matches those documents or updates them intentionally in the same change set.
- Add or update an ADR in `docs/adrs/` whenever a change introduces or changes a lasting architectural constraint, selects between credible architectural alternatives, or replaces an earlier decision. Keep drafts in `docs/adrs/proposed/`, approved-but-not-yet-implemented decisions in `docs/adrs/accepted/`, and implemented decisions in `docs/adrs/implemented/`.
- Create or update the relevant feature spec in `specs/` in the same change set whenever feature behavior, contracts, workflows, or regression guardrails change.
- Add or update a template update pack in `.template/updates/` in the same change set whenever a reusable template maintenance change should be portable to downstream projects.
- Keep the quality gate green before considering a change ready.
- Keep workflow writes explicit. New generated output, local state, cache, archive, or tool-artifact paths should be documented in the same change that introduces them.
- Do not place executable browser code inline in Worker-rendered HTML. Client behavior should live in typed TypeScript modules before it is served to browsers.

## Tooling Baseline

- Local development and local CI target macOS as the supported host platform baseline.
- Node is pinned exactly through `package.json`, and npm is constrained to a compatible major there instead of an exact patch pin.
- The verification baseline is split into a fast gate and a browser gate so quick checks can return earlier without dropping full coverage.
- The repo-managed `pre-push` Git hook should run affected-file guardrails before code is pushed.
- Formatting, Oxlint correctness checks, type checking, unit tests, and end-to-end tests are part of the baseline quality gate.
- Keep incremental mutation testing in an explicit deep local gate instead of making it an unconditional baseline phase. GitHub remains responsible for the clean full mutation signal on runtime-relevant changes.
- Keep duplicated `.github/skills/` content and vendored `.codex/skills/**/references/` material outside the Prettier baseline. Continue formatting project-owned skill entry points, specs, ADRs, and documentation.
- Cache successful Prettier checks by file content under ignored `.cache/prettier` so repeated local gates avoid unchanged files without trusting timestamps.
- Keep Oxlint focused on its default correctness rules unless additional rule categories are adopted through an explicit, documented decision. Oxlint does not replace Prettier or TypeScript checking.
- Fallow codebase diagnostics are advisory readability checks for complexity, duplication, dependency hygiene, and cleanup evidence; they do not replace the baseline quality gate.
- Affected-file guardrails should scope checks to changed files when the underlying tool supports it and fall back to project-level checks only when needed.
- Remote browser and mutation jobs should skip dependency installation and execution when every changed file is in a documented non-runtime area. Unknown paths and unavailable change ranges must run the expensive gates.
- Keep Stryker at 50% concurrency for responsive local work, while the isolated GitHub mutation job may use 100% of its runner's available parallelism.
- The fast quality gate should fail when Worker/view runtime files contain inline `<script>` tags, inline event-handler attributes, or `javascript:` URLs.
- Unit coverage for `src/` code should stay high enough that the coverage gate remains green.
- Local CI should validate the same baseline checks before non-documentation changes are proposed or merged.
- The canonical local CI command should emit Agent CI's structured lifecycle event stream so agents can track run, job, step, pause, and completion state without relying on animated terminal output. Agent command wrappers must pass that stream through live instead of buffering it until process exit.
- Targeted commands are useful while iterating, but `npm run quality:gate` and `npm run ci:local` remain the readiness baseline before proposing or landing non-documentation changes.
- Use `npm run quality:gate:deep` when local assertion-strength feedback is worth the additional mutation-testing cost.
- `npm run diagnostics:codebase` is useful during review and refactoring, but passing or failing it is not a readiness baseline by itself.
- Documentation-only changes may skip `npm run ci:local` when they do not alter executable config, generated artifacts, package metadata, source code, or tests.

## Capability Kits

- Put reusable partial-upgrade kits under `.capabilities/{capability-name}/`.
- Keep capability kits instructional and reviewable rather than fully automated by default.
- Each capability kit should include a README, a machine-readable manifest, any copyable files, package-manager recipes, and validation notes.
- Capability kits should preserve target-project conventions unless the kit explicitly documents a required constraint.
- Vendor third-party agent skills at a reviewed source revision, retain their license and source metadata, and adapt only where template compatibility requires it.

## Template Updates

- Put reusable maintenance update packs under `.template/updates/{update-id}/`.
- Keep update packs as reviewable plain files with metadata, a migration guide, and a focused patch.
- Use update packs for later changes to projects that already use this template or one of its capability kits.
- Do not treat update packs as source snapshots; preserve downstream project conventions and use the migration guide when the patch does not apply cleanly.

## Spec Conventions

- Put feature-level specs under `specs/{feature-domain}/spec.md`.
- Keep one spec per independently evolvable feature or domain.
- Update the relevant spec in the same change set whenever behavior, contracts, workflows, or guardrails change.
