# vibe-template

`vibe-template` currently ships as a Cloudflare Worker application served with Wrangler, implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript, and centered on server-rendered HTML with a small JSON API stub.

This is a template for my vibecoding projects and it captures what I consider my best practices so I don't have to repeat them for each experiment.

The repo vendors ASDLC reference material in `.asdlc/` as local guidance instead of recreating it per project. Repo-specific truth lives in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `specs/`, and `docs/adrs/`: generated code still needs to match those documents, and passing CI alone is not enough.

Local development in this repo targets macOS. Other platforms may need script and tooling adjustments before the baseline workflow works as documented.

## Documentation

- Development setup and local CI: `docs/development.md`
- Architecture decisions: `docs/adrs/README.md`
- Feature and architecture specs: `specs/README.md`
- Agent behavior and project rules: `AGENTS.md`
- Project-local agent capabilities: `.codex/skills/`
- Partial-upgrade capability kits: `.capabilities/`
- Template maintenance update packs: `.template/updates/`

## Runtime

- Run `nvm use` before `npm install` or any other development command so your shell picks up the repo-pinned Node.js version from `.nvmrc` and stays close to the expected npm baseline.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- `npm install` also configures the repo-managed `pre-push` hook so `git push` runs affected guardrails before code leaves your machine.
- The exact project Node.js version is pinned in `package.json` and mirrored in `.nvmrc` for `nvm` users, and CI reads the `package.json` value directly.
- npm is constrained to the supported npm 11 range in `package.json`; local development is expected to use `nvm use`, and CI uses the npm release bundled with the pinned Node setup as long as it satisfies that range.
- Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` before running projects that need local secrets.
- Use repo-pinned CLI tools through `npx`, including `npx wrangler` for Cloudflare-based experiments.
- Start the stub Worker with `npm run dev`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
- Rebuild the generated Tailwind stylesheet manually with `npm run build:css` when needed.

## Verification

- Run the fast local gate with `npm run quality:gate:fast` during normal iteration.
- Run the baseline repo gate with `npm run quality:gate`.
- Run the containerized local workflow with `npm run ci:local`; it emits structured run, job, and step progress for agents, uses Agent CI parallelism with warm-cache serialization, and pauses failed runners for retry.
- Run advisory codebase readability diagnostics with `npm run diagnostics:codebase`.
- The repo-managed `pre-push` hook runs `npm run quality:affected` automatically after `npm install`.
- If local Agent CI warns about `No such remote 'origin'`, set `GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo` in `.env.agent-ci`.
- Retry a paused local CI run with `npm run ci:local:retry -- --name <runner-name>`.
- Install the pinned Playwright browser with `npm run playwright:install`.
- Run unit tests from colocated `src/**/*.test.ts` files with `npm test`.
- Run browser tests from colocated `src/**/*.e2e.ts` files with `npm run e2e`.
- Run mutation tests against runtime `src/**/*.ts` files with `npm run mutation`.

## Capability Kits

Use `.capabilities/` when another project needs one template practice without adopting the whole starter. Each kit is a reviewable partial-upgrade guide with a README, manifest, package-manager recipe, copyable files, and validation checks.

The `engineering-quality-skills` kit exposes focused correctness review, test review, and systematic debugging workflows to downstream coding agents without adding runtime dependencies.

To apply a kit to another repo:

1. Pick the smallest matching kit from `.capabilities/README.md`.
2. Read the kit README and `manifest.json`.
3. Follow the target package-manager recipe under `recipes/`.
4. Copy or merge files from `files/` without overwriting target-project conventions.
5. Ask before applying optional adjacent setup such as creating a GitHub Actions workflow.
6. Run the kit checks and the target repo's normal quality gate.

For existing projects where the right kit set is unclear, start with the negotiation prompt in `.capabilities/README.md`. It asks an agent to inspect the target repo, present a checkbox-style capability pull plan, and wait for approval before editing files.

## Template Update Packs

Use `.template/updates/` to sync later maintenance changes into projects that already use this template or one of its capability kits. Each update pack has metadata, a short migration guide, and a focused patch to try before porting the change manually.

For cross-repo agent work, tell the agent:

> Look at `vibe-template/.template/updates/AGENT_SYNC.md` for latest template updates.

## Starter App

- `GET /` serves a minimal editorial Worker stub with a route index and a primary health-probe link.
- `GET /styles.css` serves the generated Tailwind stylesheet.
- `GET /api/health` serves a JSON health response for smoke tests and tooling.

## Source Layout

- `src/worker.ts` is the Worker entry point and top-level router.
- `src/api/` holds API response modules such as the health endpoint.
- `src/views/` holds HTML rendering modules for the starter UI.
- Tests live next to the code they exercise under `src/`.
