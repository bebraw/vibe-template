# vibe-template

`vibe-template` currently ships as a Cloudflare Worker application served with Wrangler, implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript, and centered on server-rendered HTML with a small JSON API stub.

This is a template for my vibecoding projects and it captures what I consider my best practices so I don't have to repeat them for each experiment.

The repo vendors ASDLC reference material in `.asdlc/` as local guidance instead of recreating it per project. Repo-specific truth lives in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `specs/`, and `docs/adrs/`: generated code still needs to match those documents, and passing CI alone is not enough.

Local development in this repo targets macOS. Other platforms may need script and tooling adjustments before the baseline workflow works as documented.

## Documentation

- Development setup and local CI: `docs/development.md`
- Architecture decisions: `docs/adrs/README.md`
- Feature and architecture specs: `specs/README.md`
- Agent behavior and project rules: `AGENTS.md`

## Runtime

- Run `nvm use` before `npm install` or any other development command so your shell picks up the repo-pinned Node.js version from `.nvmrc` and stays close to the expected npm baseline.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- `npm install` also configures the repo-managed `pre-push` hook so `git push` runs `npm run quality:gate:fast` before code leaves your machine.
- The exact project Node.js version is pinned in `package.json` and mirrored in `.nvmrc` for `nvm` users, and CI reads the `package.json` value directly.
- npm is also pinned exactly in `package.json`; local development is expected to use `nvm use`, and CI upgrades npm to the exact repo pin when the bundled npm version differs.
- Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` before running projects that need local secrets.
- Use repo-pinned CLI tools through `npx`, including `npx wrangler` for Cloudflare-based experiments.
- Start the stub Worker with `npm run dev`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
- Rebuild the generated Tailwind stylesheet manually with `npm run build:css` when needed.

## Verification

- Run the fast local gate with `npm run quality:gate:fast` during normal iteration.
- Run the baseline repo gate with `npm run quality:gate`.
- Run the containerized local workflow with `npm run ci:local:quiet`.
- Refresh the committed README screenshot with `npm run screenshot:home` when the starter UI changes materially.
- The repo-managed `pre-push` hook runs `npm run quality:gate:fast` automatically after `npm install`.
- If local Agent CI warns about `No such remote 'origin'`, set `GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo` in `.env.agent-ci`.
- Retry a paused local CI run with `npm run ci:local:retry -- --name <runner-name>`.
- Install the pinned Playwright browser with `npm run playwright:install`.
- Run unit tests from colocated `src/**/*.test.ts` files with `npm test`.
- Run browser tests from colocated `src/**/*.e2e.ts` files with `npm run e2e`.

## Starter App

- `GET /` serves a minimal editorial Worker stub with a route index and a primary health-probe link.
- `GET /styles.css` serves the generated Tailwind stylesheet.
- `GET /api/health` serves a JSON health response for smoke tests and tooling.

## Source Layout

- `src/worker.ts` is the Worker entry point and top-level router.
- `src/api/` holds API response modules such as the health endpoint.
- `src/views/` holds HTML rendering modules for the starter UI.
- Tests live next to the code they exercise under `src/`.
