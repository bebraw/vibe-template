# ADRs

This directory stores Architecture Decision Records for decisions that are significant enough to shape future work in the repo.

The default in this template is to make architectural choices explicit. If a change introduces or changes a lasting architectural constraint, chooses between credible architectural alternatives, or supersedes an earlier decision, add or update an ADR in the same change set.

Use an ADR when a decision:

- establishes a lasting technical constraint
- selects between credible architectural alternatives
- accepts a meaningful trade-off that future contributors should understand
- replaces, narrows, or broadens an earlier architecture decision

Skip an ADR for small, reversible, or purely tactical choices.

ADRs are grouped by lifecycle status:

- `proposed/` stores draft ADRs and the reusable ADR template.
- `accepted/` stores approved ADRs whose decisions are not fully implemented yet.
- `implemented/` stores ADRs only after the repo actually implements the decision, including records later marked superseded so historical decisions stay with the implemented decision log.

## Creating A New ADR

1. Read the ASDLC guidance in [`.asdlc/practices/adr-authoring.md`](../../.asdlc/practices/adr-authoring.md).
2. Copy [`ADR-000-template.md`](./proposed/ADR-000-template.md).
3. Rename it using the next sequential ID: `proposed/ADR-NNN-short-title.md`.
4. Fill in context, decision, consequences, and alternatives.
5. When the ADR is accepted but implementation is still pending, move it to `accepted/`.
6. Move an ADR to `implemented/` only after the repository actually implements the decision.
7. If the change supersedes an earlier ADR, update the old ADR status to point at the new one.
8. Update the ADR table in this file.
